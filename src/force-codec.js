/**
 * Force Video Codec.
 *
 * Lets the user pin video playback to a single codec instead of accepting
 * whatever the player and the server negotiate between them.
 *
 * WHY ANYONE WANTS THIS
 *   The negotiated codec is not always the one the set handles best. Some 2021
 *   panels advertise AV1 through MSE and then stall on it 30-60s in (issue
 *   #143); some sets decode VP9 in hardware and AV1 in software, so AV1 costs
 *   frames; some users simply want to compare. None of that is visible from
 *   inside the app, so this is a switch rather than a heuristic.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *   Three levers, all of which only ever *narrow* what the player will accept:
 *
 *     1. MediaSource.isTypeSupported - the capability probe the player runs to
 *        decide which formats to ask the server for. This is the lever that
 *        actually changes the negotiation, because the answer feeds the codec
 *        list sent upstream.
 *     2. HTMLMediaElement#canPlayType - the same question asked at the element,
 *        for the paths that go there instead.
 *     3. streamingData.adaptiveFormats / .formats - the offer that comes back.
 *        Stripped as belt and braces, in case a path trusts the offer over its
 *        own probe. This module does NOT hook JSON.parse to do it: adblock.js
 *        already owns that hook, and a second wrapper on top would be silently
 *        uninstalled the moment destroyAdblock() restored the parse function it
 *        captured before we wrapped it. adblock.js calls
 *        rewriteStreamingData() from inside its own hook instead.
 *
 *   Narrowing only is deliberate: a forced codec is never reported as supported
 *   when the platform says it is not. The worst this can do is leave the player
 *   with fewer options, never with an option the hardware cannot drive.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY WILL NOT DO
 *   - Touch audio. Audio entries and audio/* MIME types are passed through
 *     untouched; filtering them would silence playback.
 *   - Empty a format list. If the wanted codec has no rendition for a video,
 *     that list is left exactly as it was and the request is treated as
 *     unsatisfiable for that video. A stream the user did not ask for beats no
 *     stream at all.
 *   - Force a codec the platform denies. The choice is probed against the
 *     untouched isTypeSupported before any hook goes in. HEVC in particular is
 *     rarely exposed through MSE on webOS even where the panel decodes it in
 *     hardware, so that selection will usually be refused here with a message
 *     rather than producing a black screen.
 *
 * TAKES EFFECT ON RELOAD
 *   The player probes codecs once, at startup, and caches the answer. Changing
 *   this setting mid-session therefore does nothing until the app is reloaded,
 *   so the change handler says so rather than letting the setting look broken.
