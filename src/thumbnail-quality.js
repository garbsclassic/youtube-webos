/**
 * Max Thumbnail Quality — InnerTube response rewriter.
 *
 * Replaces the old DOM pipeline (a subtree MutationObserver over <ytlr-app>, a
 * per-tile style observer, an IntersectionObserver, a request queue and three
 * HEAD probes per *visible* tile, followed by a backgroundImage overwrite) with
 * an in-place rewrite of the parsed JSON, run inside the JSON.parse hook
 * adblock.js already owns.
 *
 * Why this is cheaper:
 *   - One image fetch per thumbnail instead of two. The old path let the app
 *     download YouTube's 320x180 crop and *then* downloaded the upgrade on top
 *     of it. The app never sees the low-quality URL now, so it is never
 *     requested — on a 15-tile shelf that is 15 fewer image fetches.
 *   - No pop-in. The upgrade is not a second background layer that lands a few
 *     hundred ms later; it is the only URL the app has ever been given.
 *   - No observers. The old module kept three alive for the whole session.
 *   - Off-screen tiles are upgraded too, so scrolling a shelf no longer sets
 *     off a fresh burst of probes and swaps mid-scroll.
 *
 * The one thing the DOM had that JSON does not is a failure signal: a CSS
 * background can list a fallback layer, a JSON string cannot. maxresdefault
 * does not exist for every video, and YouTube answers a miss with a small grey
 * placeholder rather than a 404 (see PLACEHOLDER_MAX_BYTES). That is handled by
 * SPECULATIVE_MODE plus the verification queue below, not by guessing.
